# Python Program to Swap Two Numbers

This Python program demonstrates how to swap two numbers in two ways:
1. Without using a third variable (using arithmetic operations).
2. Using a third variable.

## Features

- **Swap without third variable**: Uses addition and subtraction to swap the values.
- **Swap with third variable**: Uses a temporary third variable to swap the values.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required.

## Program Structure

### Functions

1. `swap_without_third_variable(a, b)`
    - Swaps two numbers without using a third variable.
    - Example: If `a = 5` and `b = 10`, after swapping: `a = 10` and `b = 5`.

2. `swap_with_third_variable(a, b)`
    - Swaps two numbers using a third variable.
    - Example: If `a = 10` and `b = 5`, after swapping: `a = 5` and `b = 10`.

### Input/Output

1. The program asks the user to input two numbers.
2. It performs swapping without using a third variable.
3. It then swaps the numbers again using a third variable.
4. Finally, it prints an incremented value of the third variable used for swapping.
